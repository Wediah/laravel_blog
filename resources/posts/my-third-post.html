    All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the config directory. Each option
    is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.
    Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several options such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change according to your application.
